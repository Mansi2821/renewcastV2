# RenewCast — Autonomous Grid Intelligence System

> **Every weather event triggers a forecast, a dispatch decision, and a regulatory-grounded advisory fully autonomous, no human in the loop.**

Built for the **Hack For Green Bharat 2026** hackathon (Pathway track).

## Live Demo Screenshots

### Dashboard — Live Grid Dispatch System

Three plants (RJ01 · GJ01 · TN01) updating in real time. P10/P50/P90 forecast bands visible. Pipeline is live  no manual refresh.

### P10 / P50 / P90 Forecast Bands — Live Chart
![Forecast Bands Chart](s2.jpeg)

Two plant forecast charts showing probabilistic generation bands updating as the River model learns from each new weather tick. The spread between P10 (pessimistic) and P90 (optimistic) is the dispatch safety margin.

### Autonomous Dispatch Commands — Live Feed
![Dispatch Commands Feed](s3.jpeg)

Every command is APPROVED by the compliance gate before reaching the SCADA output. Plant, timestamp, asset, and MW allocation logged in real time across all three plants simultaneously.

## What It Does

India's grid operators manage renewable intermittency reactively. When a dust storm drops a Rajasthan solar plant from 95 MW to 20 MW in 40 minutes, the grid already has a deficit before a peaker is called.

**RenewCast solves this by pre-scheduling fossil backup conservatively against the P10 lower bound** — so when generation disappoints, the peaker is already warming up, not being called from cold standby.

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourhandle/renewcast
cd renewcast

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — both keys are OPTIONAL (see below)

# 3. Build and run
docker compose build
docker compose up

# 4. Open dashboard
# Streamlit: http://localhost:8501
# API:       http://localhost:8000/status
```

### Local (No Docker)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.pipeline.txt
python -m pathway_pipeline.main
```

---

## API Keys

Both keys are **optional**. The system runs fully without them.

| Key | Source | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | platform.openai.com | LLM advisories show placeholder text |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | openweathermap.org (free tier) | Synthetic weather used automatically |

Everything else — forecasting, dispatch, compliance gate, anomaly detection — runs normally without any keys.

---

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/dispatch?n=20` | Last N dispatch commands |
| `/advisories?n=10` | Last N LLM operator advisories |
| `/anomalies?n=10` | Last N anomaly reports |
| `/telemetry?n=30` | Raw telemetry stream |
| `/status` | Record counts + health check |
| `/stream/dispatch` | SSE live stream (real-time) |

---

## Demo Commands

```bash
# Inject a high-severity cloud event on RJ01
docker compose run --rm pathway_pipeline python scripts/inject_event.py --type=cloud --plant=RJ01 --severity=high

# Inject inverter fault on GJ01
docker compose run --rm pathway_pipeline python scripts/inject_event.py --type=inverter_fault --plant=GJ01

# Clear all injected events
docker compose run --rm pathway_pipeline python scripts/inject_event.py --clear

# Watch live output in terminal
bash scripts/watch_outputs.sh
```

### Demo Sequence (2 min 30 sec)

| Time | Action | What You See |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 | `docker compose up` | Three plants on Streamlit, dispatch commands accumulating |
| 0:30 | Point at pipeline logs | River model tick counter, per-plant MAE improving |
| 1:00 | Inject cloud event on RJ01 | RJ01 P50 drops, RL agent increases gas backup |
| 1:20 | Show held command | Inject extreme action → appears in `held_commands.jsonl` with reason |
| 1:40 | Show LLM advisory | CERC document cited in plain-English explanation |
| 2:00 | Drop new PDF into `/docs/` | Document store re-indexes, next advisory references new doc |

## Key Technical Details

### P10 / P50 / P90 — Quantile Regression

Three independent River `LinearRegression` models with pinball loss at α = 0.10, 0.50, and 0.90. This is statistically valid quantile regression — not variance subtracted from a point forecast.

```python
class QuantileRegressor:
    def __init__(self, alpha: float):
        self.model = compose.Pipeline(
            preprocessing.StandardScaler(),
            linear_model.LinearRegression(
                optimizer=optim.SGD(lr=0.01),
                loss=optim.losses.Quantile(alpha=alpha),  # pinball loss
            ),
        )
```

The P10 is the dispatch safety input  the RL agent pre-schedules backup conservatively against the pessimistic lower bound.

### River State Persistence

River model state is serialized to `models/river_state.pkl` every 50 ticks and restored on startup. State is keyed by `plant_id` so each plant's model is fully isolated.

### Compliance Gate

Every dispatch command passes through the compliance gate before reaching the SCADA output:

1. **Ramp rate check** — if MW change exceeds plant limit (RJ01: 25 MW, GJ01: 20 MW, TN01: 15 MW), command is held and adjusted
2. **CERC must-run check** — RAG query retrieves relevant regulatory context; if must-run constraint violated, command is held

Held commands go to `held_commands.jsonl` with reason attached. Only approved commands reach `dispatch_commands.jsonl`.

### Live RAG Document Store

FAISS-backed document store watches the `/docs/` folder. Drop a new PDF or `.txt` file and it is chunked, embedded, and indexed within seconds. The next LLM advisory will reference it automatically.

### Anomaly Detection

Persistent underperformance detection: if actual generation deviates more than 15% below P50 for 6 consecutive intervals, an anomaly report is generated and written to `anomaly_reports.jsonl`.

## Adding a New Plant

1. Add to `PLANTS` list in `pathway_pipeline/config.py`
2. Add backup assets to `BACKUP_ASSETS` in `pathway_pipeline/rl_dispatch.py`
3. Add ramp limits to `RAMP_LIMIT_MW` in `pathway_pipeline/compliance_gate.py`
4. Drop a plant spec doc into `docs/plant_specs_XXXX.txt`
5. Restart pipeline — the new plant appears automatically

## Q&A

**How did you compute P10?**
Three separate River LinearRegression models with pinball loss at α = 0.10, 0.50, and 0.90. Pinball loss is the standard approach for online quantile regression. The P10 is a statistically valid 10th percentile estimate — not a margin subtracted from a point forecast.

**Is the model actually learning?**
Yes — River updates weights with every incoming data point (true online learning). MAE is tracked across ticks; the log shows `MAE=X.XXMWâ†"` when the model is improving. State is persisted across restarts.

**Does the LLM have real authority?**
Yes — the compliance gate runs before the SCADA write. Non-compliant commands are held in `held_commands.jsonl` with reasons. The LLM doesn't just explain; it gates.

**Does it scale?**
Every UDF, window, and document store query is keyed by `plant_id`. Adding a fourth plant is one config change. The architecture was built for three plants but designed for three hundred.
